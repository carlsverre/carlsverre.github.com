Ideas for v2 of carlsverre.com
------------------------------

* Game of Life running in background (canvas stretched to window size, fixed position)
* Looks awesome on a mobile device!  (important)
* simple "business card" about me at the top -> download some type of contact file?
* get rid of thelab.carlsverre.com and figure out something easier to update
  * perhaps do posts in a git-repo branch?
  * have a git-repo for standalone posts?
  * have a seperate branch in the carlsverre site repo for standalone posts?
* list latest github repos, along with a blurb extracted from something or other
* list latest tweets/gists/photos? in a stream
* list featured github repos
